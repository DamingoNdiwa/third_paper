\section{Introduction}
Several measures of prior impact assessment have been developed. These measures of prior impact are usually based on divergences such as the Kullbackâ€“Leibler divergence or distances such as the Wasserstein distance. However, these distances are not directly interpretable and cannot tell us the weight of the impact of a prior distribution. We provide the weight of impact for prior distributions relative to standard normal distributions.

\section{Examples}

\subsection{Normal-normal conjugate case with unknown mean}
Following standard arguments, it is possible to show that the power posterior for the following Bayesian model with dataset $x = (x_1, \ldots, x_n)$
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
x_1, \ldots, x_n &\sim \mathcal{N}(m, \sigma^2), \\
m &\sim \mathcal{N}(m_0, \sigma_0^2),
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
is normally distributed
\begin{equation}
m \;|\; x \sim \mathcal{N} \left( \left( \frac{1}{\sigma_0^2} + \frac{\gamma n}{\sigma^2} \right)^{-1} \left(\frac{m_0}{\sigma_0^2} + \frac{\gamma n \bar{x}}{\sigma^2}  \right), \left( \frac{1}{\sigma_0^2} + \frac{\gamma n}{\sigma^2} \right)^{-1} \right),
\end{equation}
where $\bar{x} = (\sum x_i)/ n$ is the sample mean. We remark that, as expected, the prior is recovered when $\gamma = 0$ and the classic normal-normal with unknown mean conjugate result is recovered when $\gamma = 1$. The role of $\gamma$ in this context is to reduce the contribution of each element of the dataset through the likelihood. More specifically for the normal-normal case, the effective data set size is reduced from the standard posterior ($\gamma = 1$) from $n$ to $n \gamma$ in the power posterior. Note however, regardless of the value of $\gamma > 0$, the entire dataset $x$ is still used in the update from prior to the power posterior.

The Wasserstein metric for the $p = 2$ case for two non-degenerate normal measures $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ on $\mathbb{R}$ with means $m_1, m_2 \in \mathbb{R}$ and variances $\sigma_1^2, \sigma_2^2 \in \mathbb{R}_{>0} := \left\lbrace x \in \mathbb{R} \; | \; x > 0 \right\rbrace$, respectively, can be defined in closed form as
\begin{equation}
W_{2} (\mu_1, \mu_2)^2 = \left( m_1 - m_2 \right)^2 + \sigma_1^2 + \sigma_2^2 - 2 \bigl( \sigma_2 \sigma_1^2 \sigma_2 \bigr)^{1/2}.
\end{equation}
Consequently in this case there is no need to resort to approximate numerical computations to compute the Wasserstein metric. In closed form the Wasserstein metric between the prior measure $\mu_0$ and the power posterior measure $\mu_\gamma$ is given by
\begin{equation}
W_2(\mu_0, \mu_\gamma)^2 = \sigma_{0}^{2} + \frac{\sigma^{2} \sigma_{0}^{2}}{p} + \frac{\left(\gamma m_{0} n \sigma_{0}^{2} - \gamma n \sigma_{0}^{2} \bar{x}\right)^{2}}{p^{2}} - \frac{2 \sigma \sigma_{0}^{2}}{\sqrt{p}}
\end{equation}
with $p = \gamma n \sigma_{0}^{2} + \sigma^{2}$ and the derivative of the squared Wasserstein distance with respect to $\gamma$ given by
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\frac{d}{d\gamma} &[W_2(\mu_0, \mu_\gamma)^2] = \\
p^{-\frac{15}{2}}n \sigma_{0}^{2} &\left(- p^{\frac{11}{2}} \sigma^{2} \sigma_{0}^{2} - 2 p^{\frac{9}{2}} \left(- \gamma n \sigma_{0}^{2} \bar{x} + m_{0} p - m_{0} \sigma^{2}\right) \left(- \gamma n \sigma_{0}^{2} \bar{x} - m_{0} \sigma^{2} + p \bar{x}\right) + p^{6} \sigma \sigma_{0}^{2}\right)
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Both equations were derived using a computer algebra system. Letting $\gamma = 0$ it can be verified that $W_2(\mu_0, \mu_0)^2 = 0$, as expected, and also that $\frac{d}{d\gamma}[W_2(\mu_0, \mu_0)^2] = 0$.
